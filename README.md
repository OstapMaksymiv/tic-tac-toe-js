# Tic Tac Toe TypeScript Project

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using TypeScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Player Class

The `Player` class manages the current player's turn, toggling between 'X' and 'O' and updating the display accordingly.

## PlayerX and PlayerO Classes

These classes define constants for winning conditions, indicating the end of the game for each player.

## Html Class

The `Html` class encapsulates HTML-related elements, such as tiles, player display, reset button, announcer, and constants.

## TicTacToe Class

The `TicTacToe` class orchestrates the game logic, handling user actions, result validation, and board updates.

## Usage

1. Open the [Tic Tac Toe Game](https://OstapMaksymiv.github.io/tic-tac-toe-js/tic-tak-toe/) in a web browser.
2. Players take turns clicking on the tiles to make their moves.
3. The game announces the winner or a tie when the game concludes.
4. Use the "Reset" button to start a new game.
